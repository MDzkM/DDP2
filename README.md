# Repository For DDP2 Class Archives.

## TL;DR
This is a collection of solutions for DDP2 class in the academic year of 2018/2019 second semester. I created this repository to help those who need a learning material and/or sample codes to look at while also keeping a history of my past assignments.

However, I must emphasize that the solutions displayed here are not guaranteed to be the most optimal and by far something that I can claim a best practice. So don't forget to learn and practice from another source.

Feel free to take a look around.

## File Structure
This repository consists of 10 lab tasks inside the folders labeled,

```Lab_*```


And also an additional of four programming assignments labeled as,

```TP_*```

Inside of each folders contain one or more ```*.java``` files which you can execute using the command,

```javac FILENAME.java```<br>
```java FILENAME```

or for **Java** versions **11** and above,

(only works for single-file projects)<br>
```java FILENAME.java```

and some might also include a pre-packaged ```*.jar``` file that can be run with the command,

```java -jar FILENAME.jar```

Each folder will also include the original task in the form of ```README.md``` file.

## Additional Info
Most of the solutions stored here were created in **Eclipse** so there might be some files that contains warnings or even errors like ```packages not found``` or ```FILENAME is non-project file```.

The solutions that use **JavaFX** might or might not work on your system depending on the version of **Java** you are using. As of the time of writing this, the status for **JavaFX** packages are only included in **Java** versions **8** or lower.

If you are using a later version of **Java** you can download standalone **JavaFX** packages here,

```https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/```

or here,

```https://openjfx.io/```

The inclusion of the **JavaFX** directory during compiling or runtime or when opening it as a project from **Eclipse** will not be explained here as there are many guides and threads online that already feature the code.

## Credits
All credits for the tasks goes to the original problem setters and also the **Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia**.
